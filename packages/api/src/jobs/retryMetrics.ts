/**
 * Cross-cutting Prometheus metrics for queued jobs that retry or dead-letter.
 *
 * Why this module exists
 * ──────────────────────
 * The Credence Backend has multiple job domains (outbox events, webhook
 * deliveries, email notifications, expired-session sweeps, audit-chain
 * verifier, ...) — each with its own bespoke per-domain metric.
 * Operators responding to "is anything stuck?" alerts previously had to
 * author one PromQL rule per domain. This module exports a small,
 * stable set of *generic*, cross-domain metrics with a shared
 * `domain` label, so a single rule surfaces stuck workers in
 * *every* domain simultaneously.
 *
 * Per-domain metrics continue to exist (e.g.
 * `outbox_dead_letter_total{error_code=...}`,
 * `webhook_dlq_size`, `notification_dlq_total{status=...}`); this
 * module does NOT replace them. New domains SHOULD wire into this
 * module in addition to their bespoke metrics — the cross-cutting
 * gauges are what power generic alerts.
 *
 * Metrics exposed
 * ───────────────
 * • `jobs_dead_letter_total{domain,reason}`         — Counter; a job moved to DLQ.
 * • `jobs_terminal_outcome_total{domain,outcome}`   — Counter; a job reached a
 *                                                     terminal state (succeeded
 *                                                     or dead_letter).
 * • `jobs_terminal_attempt_count{domain}`          — Histogram (1..20) of total
 *                                                     attempts consumed at the
 *                                                     moment a job terminated.
 * • `jobs_oldest_pending_age_seconds{domain}`      — Gauge; age (s) of the
 *                                                     oldest pending job per
 *                                                     domain. Rising = stuck
 *                                                     workers or paused queue.
